# EDA-and-ML-Analysis-on-Bank-Customer-Churn
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning (ML) classification to understand and predict bank customer churn using the Churn_Modelling.csv dataset. The goal is to identify key factors that influence a customer's decision to leave the bank and build predictive models to flag high-risk customers.
